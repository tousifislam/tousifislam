### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¬ I am a gravitational wave researcher as part of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra Collaboration (LVK), the LISA Consortium, and the Simulating Extreme Spacetime (SXS) Collaboration. My research primarily focuses on two key aspects: (i) building accurate models for the gravitational radiation (waveforms) and merger properties (remnants) from binary black hole (BBH) coalescence, and (ii) developing computationally efficient source characterization (parameter estimation) tools for GW data analysis. More about my works is available here: [https://tousifislam.com/](https://tousifislam.com/).

âš¡ Following are the tools/packages I have developed as a primary contributor:
- **gwModels** [https://github.com/tousifislam/gwModels](https://github.com/tousifislam/gwModels): package for data-driven and phenomenological models for gravitational waveforms
- **gwtails** [https://github.com/tousifislam/gwtails](https://github.com/tousifislam/gwtails): package for analyzing late-time tails in BBH mergers
- **gw-remnant** [https://github.com/tousifislam/gw_remnant](https://github.com/tousifislam/gw_remnant): : package for computing remnant quanties from gravitational waveforms
- **BHPTNRSurrogate** [https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/BHPTNRSurrogate](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/BHPTNRSurrogate): package for black-hole perturbation theory based surrogate waveform models
- **EMRISurrogate** [https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/EMRISurrogate](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/EMRISurrogate): package for black-hole perturbation theory based surrogate waveform models (deprecated)
- **BHPTNR_Remnant** [https://github.com/tousifislam/BHPTNR_Remnant](https://github.com/tousifislam/BHPTNR_Remnant): package for black-hole perturbation theory based surrogate remnant models
